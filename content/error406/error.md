# AGB's Fail: Theatre in Cyberspace
*A Grant Proposal by Basil Zecchinel & Cyrill Appert*

## Project Overview

Drawing from the tradition of invisible theatre—a technique that emerged in Soviet Russia and was further developed by theatre maker Augusto Boal—we propose staging a play within public cyberspace.

### The Production

Our foundation is Franz Xaver Kroetz's "WUNSCHKONZERT," a monologue script depicting an ordinary person's final hours before suicide. This deeply human narrative explores loneliness and the desire to enter the eternal void—themes that contrast sharply with our digitally optimized world.

### The Setting: Hyperreal Domesticity

We will construct an ordinary apartment—one that could belong to anyone. This space will be equipped with familiar surveillance devices: smartphones, smart speakers, perhaps even a connected refrigerator. Each device requires users to accept Terms of Service (AGBs) before use.

### Multi-Camera Perspective Theatre

Working with a professional actress, we will film the complete performance through these ordinary devices, creating multiple simultaneous perspectives. The goal is hyperrealistic illusion—viewers should believe they are witnessing something happening in real-time.

### Deployment in Cyberspace

The completed production will be deployed through strategically placed WiFi access points labeled "FREE WIFI," positioned near theatres in our respective cities. When users connect, they must accept our own Terms of Service—which will contain the actual play script, mimicking the hyperrealistic appearance of corporate legal documents.

Upon acceptance, users access our website where they can switch between camera perspectives, watching our protagonist's final moments through the lenses of surveillance capitalism's everyday devices.

### Project Details

**Project Title:** AGB's Fail

**Tech Fascism Focus:** Our project addresses the commodification of private intimacy through Terms of Service agreements that users blindly accept, surrendering their digital privacy to corporate surveillance.

**Project Description (300 words max):**

In our hyper-connected age, the idealized human is a digitally optimized über-being who transcends physical decay and transforms death into eternal digital souls. Against this backdrop, Kroetz's script presents a radically ordinary person grappling with profoundly human loneliness—the antithesis of technological transcendence.

Our intervention creates a theatre of surveillance capitalism. We construct an ordinary domestic space filled with common connected devices, each demanding AGB acceptance. Through these devices, we film an actress performing the complete script, creating multiple surveillance perspectives of intimate human vulnerability.

This material is then deployed through our own "FREE WIFI" network nodes, placed guerrilla-style in public spaces near established theatres. Users connecting to our network must accept our Terms of Service—which contain the complete play script disguised as legal documentation.

The website presents multiple camera perspectives, allowing audiences to witness the protagonist's final hours through the same surveillance apparatus that monitors our daily lives. This creates a disturbing parallel: the intimacy we surrender to tech companies through AGB acceptance becomes the very medium through which we observe human tragedy.

Our project occupies public cyberspace with decentralized networks, demonstrating alternative internet possibilities while confronting audiences with the reality of surveillance capitalism's penetration into our most private moments.

**Urgency (150 words max):**

Three critical conversations demand immediate attention in our current moment:

First, as society increasingly valorizes digital optimization and technological transcendence, we must preserve space for fundamental human vulnerability. Kroetz's script offers radical counter-narrative to corporate promises of digital immortality.

Second, the intimacy harvested by tech companies through data collection requires urgent examination. Our project makes visible the private spaces users surrender through Terms of Service acceptance, transforming abstract data extraction into visceral theatrical experience.

Third, public cyberspace needs occupation by independent networks. Our guerrilla WiFi deployment demonstrates how small, self-organized networks can create alternatives to corporate internet infrastructure, showing that digital space remains plural and contested.

These intersecting concerns—human vulnerability versus digital optimization, privacy commodification, and network autonomy—require artistic intervention now, before surveillance capitalism's normalization becomes irreversible.

**Methodology & Timeline (150 words max):**

**Week 1-2:** Actress collaboration and set construction. We build the domestic space and modify ordinary devices for multi-camera recording.

**Week 3:** Film the complete performance from all device perspectives, ensuring hyperrealistic documentation that maintains the illusion of real-time occurrence.

**Week 4:** Website development and server programming. Create the multi-perspective viewing platform with seamless camera switching capabilities.

**Week 5:** Hardware preparation and guerrilla deployment. Program WiFi access points and execute night installations near partner theatres.

**Week 6-8:** Documentation and response monitoring. Track user engagement and document public reactions.

**Potential Outcomes:** Our project might fail completely—people may ignore "FREE WIFI" due to abundant data plans, or abandon viewing due to the unsettling voyeuristic experience. Conversely, successful engagement might prompt viewers to reflect on human vulnerability and digital rights, potentially fostering real-world connection and empathy.

**Failure Probability:** ⭐ (1/5 stars)

**Failure Explanation:** Our exploration of loneliness and disconnection will likely be overlooked or immediately dismissed by users seeking quick connectivity rather than theatrical engagement.

**Exhibition Format:** Self-hosted video accessible through "FREE WIFI" access points positioned in public spaces, creating decentralized network-based exhibition.

**Budget Request:** €7,000
