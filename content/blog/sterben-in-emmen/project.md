## Sterben in Emmen

Bachelor project for "Genius Loci" in first year. Had to choose a project relating to Emmenbrücke. Photographed places that connect to the subject of death in the area.

Documented funeral homes, cemeteries, and memorial spaces around Emmenbrücke. Simple approach - find the places where death intersects with daily life in this specific location.

The project mapped how death manifests in the Emmenbrücke landscape. Not dramatic - just the quiet infrastructure that handles mortality in a Swiss municipality.
