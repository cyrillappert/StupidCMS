## ITW Computer Club

Run a computer club as a Freifach at the school where I work. Open workshop format where students work on projects they like - Raspberry Pi, Arduino, photogrammetry.

Students choose their own projects while I provide support and suggestions. More about exploration than following strict curriculum.
